# Playlist-Maker-2.0
This is an implementation of C++ to create an application for managing a playlist of songs.
- I am still working on all of its features, but the code is functional. 
- There are a couple of minor bugs that I am still fixing, but the main application is functioning.
- The code that I commented out are features that I am thinking about adding to reduce failure points, but I am still working on them and considering their best use.
